Gourse Github Animation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Gourse <gourse_>`_ is a Github repository visualization CLI that creates an interactive animation of contributions to a repo and has multiple options for moving the camera angle, exporting as images and even `showing multiple repos <gourse-multiple-repos_>`_ .

Once in a local Github repository folder just run

   (master) $ gourse

   # for help
   $ gourse -h

Online Manual Input Graphs ( `Visme <visme_>`_ )
-------------------------------------------------

`Visme <visme_>`_ is a paid for tool that lets you type in or import a ``.csv`` to a spreadsheet interface and outputs a graph from various templates like funnels, bar, col, etc. and has a more infographic feel to it with optional animations. This type of implementation would be useful to model a few **React Components** after for custom data like internal company data.
