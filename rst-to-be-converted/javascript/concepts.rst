Closures, Scoping
--------------------

From `http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-closures-with-ease/ <http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-closures-with-ease/>`_

.. note::
   A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variablesâ€”scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), it has access to the outer function's variables, and it has access to the global variables.

Async / Await

`This is a great resource for async function tips <http://2ality.com/2016/10/async-function-tips.html>`_ that covers a lot of edge cases and common senarios.
