## Front-End Checklist

After selecting a list of recommended things to implement before publishing a
site to live, [Front-Eng Checklist](https://frontendchecklist.io/) will generate
a report and give recommendations on how to add some of the enhancements that
they recommend.

## Error Reporting

## Analytics

[Segment Analytics](https://app.segment.com/accusoft-moldfield/overview)
